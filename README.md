## Building/installation

### Running directly on your server

1. Install and configure MySQL
2. Install maven and JDK >=21 if you don't have it already
3. Build the jar by running `mvn package -DskipTests=true` and place the one with dependencies at `/opt/smithereen/smithereen.jar`
4. Set up the image processing native library ([libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips)): run `java LibVipsDownloader.java` to automatically download a prebuilt one from [here](https://github.com/lovell/sharp-libvips). If you already have libvips installed on your system, you may skip this step, but be aware that not all libvips builds include all the features Smithereen needs.
5. Install and configure [imgproxy](https://docs.imgproxy.net/GETTING_STARTED)
6. Fill in the config file, see a commented example [here](examples/config.properties)
	- You can use either the local file system (default) or an S3-compatible object storage service for user-uploaded media files.
7. Create a new MySQL database and initialize it with the [schema](schema.sql) using a command (`mysql -p smithereen < schema.sql`) or any GUI like phpMyAdmin
8. Configure and start the daemon: assuming your distribution uses systemd, copy [the service file](examples/smithereen.service) to /etc/systemd/system, then run `systemctl daemon-reload` and `service smithereen start`
9. Run `java -jar /opt/smithereen/smithereen.jar /etc/smithereen/config.properties init_admin` to create the first account
10. Log into that account from your web browser, then configure the rest of the server settings from its UI

### Using Docker

Copy [Docker-specific config example](examples/config_docker.properties) to the project root directory as `config.properties` and edit it to set your domain. Also edit `docker-compose.yml` to add your imgproxy secrets. You can then use `docker-compose` to run Smithereen, MySQL, and imgproxy. You still need to [configure your web server to reverse proxy the port 4567](examples/nginx.conf). Create the first account by running `docker-compose exec web bash -c ./smithereen-init-admin`.

### Using S3 object storage

Smithereen supports S3-compatible object storage for user-uploaded media files (but not media file cache for files downloaded from other servers).

To enable S3 storage, set `upload.backend=s3` in your `config.properties`. Configure other properties depending on your cloud provider:
- `upload.s3.region`: the region to use, `us-east-1` by default. Required for AWS, but some other cloud providers accept arbitrary values here.
- `upload.s3.endpoint`: the S3 endpoint, `s3.<region>.amazonaws.com` by default. Required if **not** using AWS.
- `upload.s3.key_id` and `upload.s3.secret_key`: your credentials for request authentication.
- `upload.s3.bucket`: the name of your bucket.
- `upload.s3.override_path_style`: if `upload.s3.endpoint` is set, set this to `true` if your cloud provider requires 
putting the bucket name into the hostname instead of in the path for API requests, like `<bucket>.<endpoint>`.
- `upload.s3.protocol`: `https` by default, can be set to `http`.

The following properties control the public URLs for clients to read the files from your S3 bucket. These are used for imgproxy and given out to clients directly when they click "Open original" in the image viewer, and will be used for non-image (e.g. video) attachments in a future Smithereen version:
- `upload.s3.hostname`: defaults to `s3-<region>.amazonaws.com`. Needs to be set if not using AWS and `upload.s3.alias_host` is not set.
- `upload.s3.alias_host`: can be used instead of `upload.s3.hostname` if you don't want your bucket name to be visible. Requires that you have a CDN or a reverse proxy in front of the storage provider.
  - If this is set, the bucket name is **not** included in the generated URLs. The URLs will have the form of `<protocol>://<alias_host>/<object>`.
  - If this is **not** set, the generated URLs will be of the form `<protocol>://<hostname>/<bucket>/<object>`.

You will need to configure your bucket to allow anonymous read access to objects, but not allow directory listing. [Refer to Mastodon documentation on how to do this on different cloud providers.](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage/#minio)

You will also need to configure imgproxy to allow it to access your S3 storage:
```
IMGPROXY_ALLOWED_SOURCES=local://,https://<your S3 hostname or alias host>/
```
[Make sure to include a trailing slash in the URL.](https://docs.imgproxy.net/configuration/options#IMGPROXY_ALLOWED_SOURCES)

## Federating with Smithereen

Smithereen supports various features not found in most other ActivityPub server software. [See the federation document](/FEDERATION.md) if you would like to implement these ActivityPub extensions in your project.
